# Implement a Web Page From Scratch  
*A pure HTML & CSS project — no libraries, no shortcuts.*

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a **fully functional web page from scratch**, using only **HTML** and **CSS**. You will recreate the provided designer file as accurately as possible while applying everything you’ve learned about:

- Semantic HTML  
- CSS styling  
- Accessibility  
- Responsive design  

There are intentionally **few instructions** — the goal is to think like a front‑end developer and translate a design into a real, working interface.

## Objectives

- Structure a web page using clean, semantic HTML  
- Style components using modern CSS  
- Implement responsive layouts for mobile and desktop  
- Apply accessibility best practices  
- Reproduce a designer’s layout with precision  
- Build without relying on external CSS frameworks
